# Search function Implemented in HTML, CSS and JavaScript by Petrus Jonsson
## Instructions
The application can be started by opening src/index.html in a web browser or running a basic web server(for example http-server) in src/.

## API
I used an open REST API with countries: https://restcountries.eu/rest/v2/

## The task
My intention was to use the appropriate amount of tools, libraries and frameworks for the task. I decided to use HTML, CSS and JavaScript without framework and only one very lightweight JavaScript library for auto-correct. I could have implemented the auto-correct functionality myself but since the instructions told me not to focus on advanced JavaScript I thought it would be unneccesary to reinvent it in this specific task.

### Build system/bundler
I did not use any bundlers or build system in this task because my choice of tools did not require any. I have experience using Gulp and Webpack, which I could have use if needed.

### JavaScript
I could have solved this task using AngularJs, Angular 4, React or using JQuery too, but now I did it in plain JavaScript for simplicity and to show that I can use only JavaScript as well.

### Styling
Since this was a rather small application I used CSS3 without any pre-processors. I am very comfortable in SASS as well, but that would require some sort of bundler or build system which would make the application more complicated than it needs to.
